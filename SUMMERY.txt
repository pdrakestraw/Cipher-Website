Caesar Cipher Learning – Summary Document

1. Project Specification
This web application is designed to teach users about the Caesar Cipher, one of the simplest and earliest encryption methods. The project features a homepage, educational content, 
and an interactive cipher tool that lets users enter messages and shift values to see real-time encryption. It also includes interactive elements like draggable widgets, 
animated text, and plugin-enhanced features to enrich user experience.

2. Stakeholder/Client Needs & Future Plan
The target users are students and beginners in cybersecurity or computer science who want to learn how classical encryption works. The tool is intuitive, visually clean, and interactive to 
suit both casual learners and educators.

Future Improvements:
- Add decryption functionality alongside encryption.
- Extend the tool to support additional ciphers like Vigenère or ROT13.
- Add mobile responsiveness.
- Host content on a custom domain or educational subdomain.
- Include interactive history and examples of cipher use.

3. Spelling and Grammar
All written content on the site, including instructional paragraphs and labels, was carefully reviewed for proper spelling and grammar. The site maintains a consistent and professional 
tone appropriate for educational use.

4. Formatting and Writing Style
The writing style is concise, instructional, and clear. Headings are used to organize information, and text is presented in readable sections. The result output and copy icon are aligned with 
accessibility and user expectations.
